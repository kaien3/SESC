GCC-based cross compiler for SESC

This is built by using sescutils.tar.bz2,
 that is aquired from the following Web.

  https://sourceforge.net/projects/sesc/files/

You can run this cross compiler only on cygwin64.

This is tested on cygwin64 3.0.7(0.338/5/3) 2019-04-30.

This cross compiler produces MIPS-EL (little-endian MIPS) Linux binary codes.
So, the produced binary codes cannot be run on the original SESC simulator, that requires MIPS-EB (big-endian MIPS) Linux binary codes.
