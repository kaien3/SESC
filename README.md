# SESC: SuperESCalar Simulator (modified)

This repository is a modified edition of SESC (SuperESCalar), multi-core superscalar processor simulator.  
(based on unofficial repository https://github.com/ticksmas/sesc,  
because the original repository at sesc.cvs.sourceforge.net was not available.)

I am an out-sider of the developer team of SESC.

Please visit the official web-site http://sesc.sourceforge.net/ 
for more information.

But DO NOT ASK them about this modified SESC simulator.
